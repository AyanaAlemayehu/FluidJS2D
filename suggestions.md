### Research, Resources, and Similar Projects: 

* ["Stable Fluids" by Joe Stam](https://d2f99xq7vri1nk.cloudfront.net/legacy_app_files/pdf/ns.pdf) is a reasearch paper on how to build animations based on fluid dynamics. There is also a GitHub [JS project](https://github.com/teammcr192/JS-fluid-solver) and a [demo](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~teammco/projects/fluids_simulation/) that was built based off that. The paper is pretty long, but it might be helpful for your project. 

* [SPlisHSPlasH](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH) is an opens-source library for the physically-based simulation of fluids. It's built in C++ and Python. 

* [2D Liquid Simulation](https://github.com/Erkaman/gl-water2d) was built using WebGL. It mainly uses JavaScript, but there's some Python as well. Just like the previous library, it's under MIT license. 

* ["Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games" by Jos Stam](https://d2f99xq7vri1nk.cloudfront.net/legacy_app_files/pdf/talks/jos_gdc03.pdf) looks to be helpful. This is the presentation with pictures, there's also some code. 

*  The [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html) by Mike Ash might be helpful as well.

*  [#Fluid-simulation](https://github.com/topics/fluid-simulation) tag in GitHub seems to have a lot of good material.
