<!--
    This is the demo html file that I will use to develop my library. The goal is to create a visualization
    of a solution to a simple two plate fluid problem. I want to have...
    - A slider and play button to change the time (and to pause)
    - A 2D array that serves as the foundation of the "CPlane" (Cartesian Plane)
    - path, streak, and streamlines.
    - the fact that when you click, particles spawn around your mouse and flow along
    their respective pathlines (this will be cool! also shows streaklines when you hold down click)
    - A colored overlay that shows velocity (red is big fast, blue is big slow, need to make this relative)
        -probably find the fastest bit and divide by all of those
    
    SOMEHOW EVENTUALLY MAYBE
        -be able to change the function within the simulation
        -have (dammit i forgot)
